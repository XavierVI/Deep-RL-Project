# About
This repository is an extension of an assignment from a class I took on deep reinforcement learning. It contains an implementation of REINFORCE, SARSA, and advantage actor critic (A2C). It is currently being extended to perform object detection on enemies in [VizDoom](https://vizdoom.cs.put.edu.pl/).

The goal of this project was to practice fundamentals in machine learning. Specifically training models with reinforcement learning, optimizing training loops, and fine-tuning existing models.

# Installation
This project requires the packages in `requirements.txt`.
